# Standards and links

<p class="lead">The government and Defra standards this site builds on. Our guardrails apply these to Defra's context - they do not replace them.</p>

## Cross-government architecture

Other parts of government publish architecture in the open. We reuse their models and approaches rather than inventing our own.

| Resource | What it is | How it relates to this site |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Secure by Design artefact library](https://github.com/co-cddo/SbD) | Reusable security patterns, blueprints, checklists and threat models, run in the open on GitHub | Linked from [Secure by Design in Defra](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/security/secure-by-design/) and [threat modelling](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/security/threat-modelling/) |
| [OCTO architecture resources](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/) | Cross-government enterprise architecture from the Office of the Government CTO: capability model, reference architectures, self-assessment tools and AI enablement | The home of the models below |
| [Digital Technology Capability Model](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital-capability-model/index.html) | A six-level common language for a department's technology landscape | Not used for the technology capability model, which follows Technology Business Management (TBM). Useful when comparing Defra with other departments |
| [Citizen Facing Reference Architecture](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/citizen-architecture/CF.html) | How citizen-facing government services fit together, from channels to infrastructure | Our [transactional service](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/service/transactional-service/) reference architecture is Defra's detailed view of it |
| [Architecture maturity self-assessment](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Tools/index.html) | A 10-minute self-assessment of architecture practice across 14 dimensions | Use it to assess an architecture team or SDA; see the [roadmap](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/roadmap/) |
| [AI technology enablement](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/psai-tech/index.html) | AI risk toolkit, assurance questionnaire and governance operating model | Linked from the [AI guardrails](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/ai/) |
| [Local Government Architecture Model](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/gds-local/) | GDS Local's layered model of the technology councils use, from public channels and shared components down to service and corporate systems | Inspired the layered view in our [technology capability map](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/technology-capabilities/#the-capability-map). Useful where Defra services work with councils, such as planning, waste and environmental health |
| [Government data architecture](https://data-architecture.datamarketplace.gov.uk/) | Cross-government data architecture guidance from the Data Marketplace | Complements our [data architecture](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/data/) and [data standards](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/data/data-standards/) |
| [Lightweight architecture for learning at pace](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2026/08/28/lightweight-architecture-for-learning-at-pace/) | Government Technology blog post on lightweight, trust-based architecture practice | Reflected in our [advice-first governance](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/#seek-advice-not-permission) |

## Inspiration

We have learned from other departments working in the open, in particular the [DfE architecture site](https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/). Thank you.
