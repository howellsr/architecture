# Roadmap

<p class="lead">What we are working on, what comes next and what we are considering. This site is in <strong>alpha</strong>: we are developing it in the open and it will change as we learn from the teams and partners who use it.</p>

<div class="da-roadmap" markdown>

<section class="da-roadmap__col da-roadmap__col--now" aria-labelledby="roadmap-now" markdown>

<h2 id="roadmap-now"><span class="da-roadmap__tag">Now</span> Iterate, refine and embed guardrails</h2>

- Test the [guardrails](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/) and [decision check](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/decision-check/) with delivery teams and partners, and act on what we learn
- Confirm the content marked **Draft - to be confirmed**, starting with governance, the [NFR targets](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/nfrs/catalogue/) and [service tiers](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/nfrs/service-tiers/)
- Embed the guardrails in [solution design authorities](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/solution-design-authorities/) and the [TDA](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/tda/), so reviews start from the same defaults
- Refine the [DDTS doctrine](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/doctrine/) with colleagues across DDTS
- Answer the [open questions](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/open-questions/) - names, lead times, approvals and contacts we have not yet confirmed
- Take the draft guardrails and the [approval status](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/approval-status/) of each section to the TDA and TGB, and cut the first citable [release](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/releases/)
- Move the site to a [Defra GitHub organisation](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/moving-to-defra/), with redirects so existing links keep working

<section class="da-roadmap__col da-roadmap__col--next" aria-labelledby="roadmap-next" markdown>

<h2 id="roadmap-next"><span class="da-roadmap__tag">Next</span> Capabilities and decisions</h2>

- Refine the [business capabilities](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/business-capabilities/), agreeing the level 2 capabilities with business owners
- Map business capabilities to [technology capabilities](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/technology-capabilities/), and to the products and platforms that deliver them
- Collate [architecture decision records](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/architecture-decision-records/) from across Defra into a searchable register, so teams can reuse each other's decisions
- **AI architecture facilitator agent:** with the team's agreement, an agent joins stand-ups and design conversations to:
    - spot decisions as they are made and draft [decision records](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/architecture-decision-records/)
    - check them against the [guardrails](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/) and the [decision check](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/decision-check/)
    - raise risks, missing evidence and exceptions early

    A named person always confirms what is recorded ([GR-AI-03](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/ai/#gr-ai-03)), and the trial will have a DPIA and be published as an algorithmic transparency record ([GR-AI-04](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/ai/#gr-ai-04))

</section>

<section class="da-roadmap__col da-roadmap__col--later" aria-labelledby="roadmap-later" markdown>

<h2 id="roadmap-later"><span class="da-roadmap__tag">Later</span> Proposed</h2>

- Develop the proposed [service patterns](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/service/) for field inspection, incident response and grants with the teams who own those capabilities
- Grow the [patterns](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/) library, starting with infrastructure patterns
- Measure how quickly teams get to a decision, and publish the results
- **AI tools:** an assistant that answers architecture questions from this site, suggests which guardrails and capabilities apply to a design, and drafts decision records for teams to check
- **Architecture review automation:** extend the [guardrail check](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/guardrail-check/) beyond its first seven guardrails - for example hosting and infrastructure as code - so reviews focus on judgement rather than checklists
- Assess our architecture practice with the cross-government [maturity self-assessment](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Tools/index.html), and publish what we will improve
- Move to beta

## Done recently

- Structured metadata for every guardrail, with phase and status filters in the [guardrail library](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/library/)
- [Deliver a service](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/): what each phase needs, with evidence checklists and [getting onto Defra platforms](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/platforms/)
- [Patterns](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/), a [worked example](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/worked-example/) and proposed service patterns for the capability gaps
- [Delivery partners](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/delivery-partners/): contracting, mobilisation, handover and working with other suppliers
- [Releases](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/releases/), [approval status](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/approval-status/), the [exception register](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/exception-register/) and [guardrails health](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/guardrails-health/)
- The first automated [guardrail check](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/guardrail-check/) for repositories


## Guardrail backlog {#guardrail-backlog}

Work on the roadmap and the backlog is tracked in the repository's GitHub Project - see [where things live](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/contribute/where-things-live/#where-to-find-and-change-things).

Guardrails we know we are missing, found by tracing each [doctrine and principle](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/#how-the-doctrine-principles-and-guardrails-line-up) to the guardrails that put it into practice. Priorities are a starting point for discussion.

| Priority | Proposed guardrails | The gap | Doctrine and principle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | **Agreed Defra on a page** | Publish the agreed enterprise data model to replace the draft [Defra on a page](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/data/defra-on-a-page/), with the authoritative source for each entity confirmed | [4.
