# Products and platforms

<p class="lead">Defra builds and runs technology as long-lived products on shared platforms, not as one-off projects. These draft guardrails describe what that means for teams.</p>

<div class="da-trace" markdown>

**Doctrine:** [1. Platforms before projects. Built as products](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/doctrine/#ddts-01), [2. Standards and guardrails before exceptions](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/doctrine/#ddts-02), [3. Reuse before buy](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/doctrine/#ddts-03)  
**Principles:** [1. Delivery-focused architecture](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/architecture-principles/#gr-prin-01), [3. Maximise value, minimise waste](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/architecture-principles/#gr-prin-03)

!!! info "Who these guardrails apply to"
    The core department. Whether the products and platforms guardrails also apply to Defra's arm's length bodies is [still to be confirmed](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/#arms-length-bodies).


Applies the DDTS doctrine [platforms before projects](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/principles/doctrine/#ddts-01).

!!! info "Draft guardrails"
    These guardrails are new drafts from the [guardrail backlog](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/roadmap/#guardrail-backlog). Comment on them by [opening an issue](https://github.com/DEFRA/architecture/issues).

## GR-PROD-01 Fund and run products, not projects {#gr-prod-01}

<span class="rfc rfc--should">Should</span> Build and run digital services as products, owned by a long-lived team that keeps improving them, rather than as projects that end at go-live.

**Why:** services are used for years. When the team that built a service disbands at launch, knowledge is lost, technical debt grows and the service slowly fails its users.

**How to meet it:** plan funding and team continuity beyond go-live from the start. If a project model is unavoidable, agree before go-live which product team will own the service in live ([GR-OPS-05](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/observability-and-operations/#gr-ops-05)).

## GR-PROD-02 Name the product owner and service owner {#gr-prod-02}

<span class="rfc rfc--should">Should</span> Every product has a named product owner, and every service a named service owner, who are accountable for it throughout its life.

**Why:** decisions about priorities, risk and retirement need someone with the authority to make them.

**How to meet it:** record both in the service catalogue and in the repository README, and keep them current when people move on.

## GR-PROD-03 Contribute to platforms rather than working around them {#gr-prod-03}

<span class="rfc rfc--should">Should</span> When a shared platform does not meet a need, raise it with the platform team and contribute to fixing it, rather than building a local workaround.

**Why:** every workaround becomes something else to secure, support and eventually remove, and other teams have the same need.

**How to meet it:** talk to the platform team first. If you must work around a gap to meet a deadline, record it in an ADR with a plan to move back on to the platform.

## GR-PROD-04 Plan for the end of a product's life {#gr-prod-04}

<span class="rfc rfc--should">Should</span> Know where each product is in its lifecycle - growing, stable, being replaced or retiring - and plan its retirement as deliberately as its launch.

**Why:** products that linger after they are replaced keep costing money and carrying risk.

**How to meet it:** record the lifecycle stage in the service catalogue, and follow [retire a service](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/retire/) when the time comes.
