# NFR catalogue

<p class="lead">Defra's standard non-functional requirements. Start from these rather than writing your own, so services are consistent and assessors know what good looks like.</p>

!!! warning "Draft - to be confirmed"
    Parts of this page, such as names, timings and thresholds, are still being confirmed by the architecture team. Use it as a guide, and check with your solution design authority before relying on the detail.



**How to use it:** pick your [service tier](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/nfrs/service-tiers/), copy the requirements that apply into your backlog with the target for your tier, and add any service-specific NFRs using the guidance on [writing good NFRs](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/nfrs/writing-nfrs/). Ids such as `NFR-AVL-01` are stable, so you can reference them in stories, test reports and contracts.
