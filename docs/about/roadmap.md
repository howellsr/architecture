# Roadmap

<p class="lead">What we are working on, what comes next and what we are considering. This site is in <strong>alpha</strong>: we are developing it in the open and it will change as we learn from the teams and partners who use it.</p>

<div class="da-roadmap" markdown>

<section class="da-roadmap__col da-roadmap__col--now" aria-labelledby="roadmap-now" markdown>

<h2 id="roadmap-now"><span class="da-roadmap__tag">Now</span> Iterate, refine and embed guardrails</h2>

- Test the [guardrails](../guardrails/index.md) and [decision check](../governance/decision-check.md) with delivery teams and partners, and act on what we learn
- Confirm the content marked **Draft - to be confirmed**, starting with governance, the [NFR targets](../nfrs/catalogue.md) and [service tiers](../nfrs/service-tiers.md)
- Embed the guardrails in [solution design authorities](../governance/solution-design-authorities.md) and the [TDA](../governance/tda.md), so reviews start from the same defaults
- Refine the [DDTS doctrine](../principles/doctrine.md) with colleagues across DDTS
- Answer the [open questions](open-questions.md) - names, lead times, approvals and contacts we have not yet confirmed
- Take the draft guardrails and the [approval status](approval-status.md) of each section to the TDA and TGB, and cut the first citable [release](releases.md)
- Move the site to a [Defra GitHub organisation](moving-to-defra.md), with redirects so existing links keep working

</section>

<section class="da-roadmap__col da-roadmap__col--next" aria-labelledby="roadmap-next" markdown>

<h2 id="roadmap-next"><span class="da-roadmap__tag">Next</span> Capabilities and decisions</h2>

- Refine the [business capabilities](../handrail/business-capabilities.md), agreeing the level 2 capabilities with business owners
- Map business capabilities to [technology capabilities](../handrail/technology-capabilities.md), and to the products and platforms that deliver them
- Collate [architecture decision records](../governance/architecture-decision-records.md) from across Defra into a searchable register, so teams can reuse each other's decisions
- **AI architecture facilitator agent:** with the team's agreement, an agent joins stand-ups and design conversations to:
    - spot decisions as they are made and draft [decision records](../governance/architecture-decision-records.md)
    - check them against the [guardrails](../guardrails/index.md) and the [decision check](../governance/decision-check.md)
    - raise risks, missing evidence and exceptions early

    A named person always confirms what is recorded ([GR-AI-03](../guardrails/ai.md#gr-ai-03)), and the trial will have a DPIA and be published as an algorithmic transparency record ([GR-AI-04](../guardrails/ai.md#gr-ai-04))

</section>

<section class="da-roadmap__col da-roadmap__col--later" aria-labelledby="roadmap-later" markdown>

<h2 id="roadmap-later"><span class="da-roadmap__tag">Later</span> Proposed</h2>

- Develop the proposed [reference architectures](../handrail/reference-architectures/index.md) for field inspection, incident response and grants with the teams who own those capabilities
- Grow the [patterns](../patterns/index.md) library, starting with infrastructure patterns
- Measure how quickly teams get to a decision, and publish the results
- **AI tools:** an assistant that answers architecture questions from this site, suggests which guardrails and capabilities apply to a design, and drafts decision records for teams to check
- **Architecture review automation:** extend the [guardrail check](../deliver/guardrail-check.md) beyond its first seven guardrails - for example hosting and infrastructure as code - so reviews focus on judgement rather than checklists
- Assess our architecture practice with the cross-government [maturity self-assessment](https://architecture.cddo.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Tools/index.html), and publish what we will improve
- Move to beta

</section>

## Done recently

- Structured metadata for every guardrail, with phase and status filters in the [guardrail library](../guardrails/library.md)
- [Deliver a service](../deliver/index.md): what each phase needs, with evidence checklists and [getting onto Defra platforms](../deliver/platforms.md)
- [Patterns](../patterns/index.md), a [worked example](../patterns/worked-example/index.md) and proposed reference architectures for the capability gaps
- [Delivery partners](delivery-partners.md): contracting, mobilisation, handover and working with other suppliers
- [Releases](releases.md), [approval status](approval-status.md), the [exception register](../governance/exception-register.md) and [guardrails health](../governance/guardrails-health.md)
- The first automated [guardrail check](../deliver/guardrail-check.md) for repositories


## Guardrail backlog {#guardrail-backlog}

Work on the roadmap and the backlog is tracked in the repository's GitHub Project - see [where things live](../contribute/where-things-live.md#where-to-find-and-change-things). Each backlog item has an issue: select its name to comment on it, or see [every backlog issue](https://github.com/DEFRA/architecture/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aguardrail-backlog).

Guardrails we know we are missing, found by tracing each [doctrine and principle](../principles/index.md#how-the-doctrine-principles-and-guardrails-line-up) to the guardrails that put it into practice. Priorities are a starting point for discussion.
