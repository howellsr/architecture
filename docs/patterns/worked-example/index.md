# Worked example: apply for a licence

<p class="lead">A fictional Defra service, followed from context to containers, decisions and threats, to show how the reference architecture, patterns and guardrails fit together.</p>

!!! info "This service is fictional"
    "Apply for a riverside works licence" is invented for this example. The names, volumes and decisions are illustrative and do not describe a real Defra service or system.

## The service

Landowners, farmers and contractors need a licence before doing certain works next to a river. Today they email a form and supporting documents. The new service lets them apply online, on their own behalf or as an agent for a landowner, upload a site plan and photos, and pay a fee. Applications are assessed by staff in a case management system.

| Aspect | In this example |
| --- | --- |
| Users | Landowners, farmers, contractors and agents; assessing staff |
| Volume | Around 5,000 applications a year, with peaks in spring |
| Business capability | [05 Issue licences and permits](../../handrail/business-capabilities.md#bc05) |
| Starting point | [Transactional digital service](../../handrail/reference-architectures/transactional-service.md) reference architecture |
| Service tier | T3 Standard - see [service tiers](../../nfrs/service-tiers.md) |
| Patterns used | [Asynchronous submission](../async-submission.md), [acting on behalf](../acting-on-behalf.md), [file upload with malware scanning](../file-upload.md), [authoritative source](../authoritative-source.md) |

## C4 system context

The system context shows the service, the people who use it and the systems it depends on.

    accTitle: System context for the fictional apply for a licence service
    accDescr: Applicants and agents use the apply for a licence service. Assessing staff use case management to decide applications. The service uses Defra ID for sign-in, the authoritative customer and land data for organisations, holdings and land parcels, GOV.UK Pay for fees and GOV.UK Notify for emails. It hands submitted applications to case management, which records decisions and issues licences.

## C4 containers

The container diagram opens up the service: what runs where and how the parts talk.

```mermaid

    accTitle: Container diagram for the fictional apply for a licence service
    accDescr: On the Core Delivery Platform, a server-rendered front end calls the application API. The API stores applications and an outbox in a database, checks authorisation for the organisation the user acts for, and records uploaded files. Files go to a quarantine store, are scanned, and clean files move to a clean store. A relay publishes application submitted events to messaging, which case management consumes. The front end uses Defra ID and GOV.UK Pay; the API reads customer and land data and sends emails through GOV.UK Notify. Logs and metrics go to platform observability.

## What users see

The journey follows the patterns it uses, from a user's point of view:

1. **Sign in** with Defra Customer Identity. An agent then chooses which landowner they are applying for; a landowner applying for themselves goes straight on ([acting on behalf](../acting-on-behalf.md#what-users-see)).
2. **Answer questions about the works and the site**, one thing per page, saving as they go so they can come back.
3. **Upload a site plan and photos**, with the accepted types and sizes stated up front and each file's status shown while it is checked ([file upload](../file-upload.md#what-users-see)).
4. **Check their answers and pay the fee** with GOV.UK Pay.
5. **See a confirmation page** with a reference number and how long a decision takes, and get the same in an email ([asynchronous submission](../async-submission.md#what-users-see)). Agents also see the landowner's name.
6. **Come back to check the status**, and get an email when a decision is made.

Assessing staff see the application, its files and its status in case management, and only files that have passed the malware scan.

## Content to design

The team's content designer worked with the developers and the licensing team on:

- **The confirmation page and email:** the reference number, who applied for whom, and the assessment time the licensing team agreed to - not a guess.
- **File upload messages:** the accepted types and sizes, the "checking your file" message, and what to say when a file is rejected, without alarming users.
- **Agent and owner wording:** "your land" for owners, the landowner's name for agents, on every page and in every email.
- **Payment problems:** what happens to the application if payment fails or the user leaves before paying.
- **Delays in spring:** how the status page and emails explain a longer wait when applications peak.

## What to test with users

In alpha, the team tested with landowners, farmers, contractors and agents, including some on poor rural connections:

- whether agents could find and choose the right landowner, and noticed who they were applying for
- how long uploading a site plan and photos from a phone took in the field, and what users did while files were checked
- whether users kept their reference number and understood when to expect a decision
- what users did when told a file could not be uploaded
- whether the fee and what it pays for were clear before they started

These findings shaped [ADR 0003](adrs.md#adr-0003), which uses the authoritative relationships so agents only see landowners they act for.

## Decisions

The team recorded its significant decisions as ADRs ([GR-DEV-09](../../guardrails/software-development.md#gr-dev-09)). Three are shown in full on the [sample ADRs](adrs.md) page:

| ADR | Decision | Guardrails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0001](adrs.md#adr-0001) | Host on the Core Delivery Platform | `GR-HOST-01`, `GR-TECH-01` |
| [0002](adrs.md#adr-0002) | Accept applications asynchronously with an outbox | `GR-API-05`, `GR-API-06`, `GR-OPS-04` |
| [0003](adrs.md#adr-0003) | Use Defra ID and the authoritative relationships for agents | `GR-IAM-01`, `GR-IAM-04`, `GR-DATA-02` |

## Threats

The team ran a STRIDE threat model in alpha. An excerpt is on the [threat model excerpt](threat-model.md) page.

## How it lines up with the guardrails

| Concern | What the team did | Guardrails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reuse | Started from the transactional reference architecture and used strategic capabilities for identity, payments and notifications | `GR-TECH-01` |
| Hosting | Core Delivery Platform; infrastructure as code from the platform templates | `GR-HOST-01`, `GR-HOST-03` |
| Integration | Event to case management through the outbox; no shared database | `GR-API-05`, `GR-API-06`, `GR-API-02` |
| Identity | Defra ID; authorisation per organisation and holding in the API | `GR-IAM-01`, `GR-IAM-04` |
| Data | Stores ids for customers, holdings and parcels; DPIA completed | `GR-DATA-02`, `GR-DATA-06` |
| Security | Threat model, file scanning, IT health check before beta | `GR-SEC-02`, `GR-SEC-06` |
| Front end | GOV.UK Frontend, server-rendered, works without JavaScript | `GR-FE-02`, `GR-FE-03` |
| Operations | Platform observability; runbooks before public beta | `GR-OPS-01`, `GR-OPS-05` |
