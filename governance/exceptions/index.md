# Exceptions to guardrails

<p class="lead">Guardrails are defaults, and sometimes the right answer is different. The exception process gives you a quick, recorded decision - and tells us when a guardrail needs to change.</p>

!!! warning "Draft - to be confirmed"
    Parts of this page, such as names, timings and thresholds, are still being confirmed by the architecture team. Use it as a guide, and check with your solution design authority before relying on the detail.



## Which process

| You cannot meet... | Route | Record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A **Could** guardrail | No process needed | Optional |
| A **Should** guardrail | Your [solution design authority](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/solution-design-authorities/) | An ADR |
| A **Must** guardrail | The [Technical Design Authority](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/tda/) | An [exception request](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/templates/exception-request/) and an ADR |
| A **security control** | The [security exception process](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/security/managing-exceptions/), alongside the above | A security risk record |

## Exceptions to the software development standards

The [Defra software development standards](https://defra.github.io/software-development-standards/) are mandatory, and the Delivery Architecture team handles exceptions to them through its own governance process - see [software development](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/software-development) in the Defra Digital Service Manual. Some guardrails, such as [GR-DEV-01](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/software-development/#gr-dev-01) and [GR-HOST-01](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/hosting-and-platforms/#gr-host-01), cover the same ground.

!!! warning "To be confirmed"
    **TODO:** how an exception to a Must guardrail agreed at the Technical Design Authority relates to the Delivery Architecture team's exception process for the software development standards - whether one request can cover both, and which comes first.

## What a good exception request includes

- The guardrail id and what you propose instead
- Why the guardrail cannot be met - the user, business, technical or commercial reason
- The risks of the exception and how you will manage them
- How long the exception is needed, and what would let you return to the guardrail
- The cost of meeting the guardrail, if that is the reason

## Principles

- **Time-limited.** Exceptions have an expiry date, normally no more than 12 months, and are reviewed before renewal.
- **Recorded in the open.** The exception register is published, except for security-sensitive details.
- **Quick.** The TDA aims to decide within 10 working days of a complete request. Urgent requests can be handled out of cycle by the chair.
- **Feedback loop.** Every quarter, the architecture team reviews exceptions. Where several teams need the same one, we propose a guardrail change to the TGB.
