# Getting onto Defra platforms

<p class="lead">The shared platforms most Defra services use, what each gives you, and how to get access. Using them is usually faster, cheaper and safer than building your own.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



Ask for access early - in discovery or early alpha - because some platforms need onboarding, approvals or security checks before you can use them. The [technology capability catalogue](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/technology-capabilities/) lists every strategic option, including ones not shown here.

Where we have not yet confirmed a detail, such as a lead time or support channel, it is marked "To be confirmed" and listed on the [open questions](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/open-questions/) page.

Then read the [onboarding considerations](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/onboarding/onboarding-considerations.md), [architectural overview](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/architecture/architectural-overview.md) and [how-to documentation](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/how-to/how-to.md). |

## Defra Customer Identity (also known as Defra ID or IDMv2) {#defra-id}

Sign-in once to many Defra services for external users and the organisations they act for. It uses GOV.UK One Login and HMRC's Government Gateway as identity providers, offers invitation-only access for trusted third parties, and stores users' contact details, organisation accounts and the relationships between them centrally. Defra services get GOV.UK One Login through Customer Identity rather than integrating with it directly.

| **How to request access** | Talk to the Delivery Architecture team in discovery about the level of identity assurance you need and how users act for organisations ([GR-IAM-01](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/identity-and-access/#gr-iam-01)). |
