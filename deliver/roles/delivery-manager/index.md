# Delivery manager

<p class="lead">The guardrails a delivery manager leads, what to show in each phase, the patterns that help and when to work with an architect.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



You keep the team delivering and the governance light. You make sure evidence is gathered as the team goes, not at the end, and that the service is ready to run in live.

You lead **10 guardrails**, often with other roles. Leading means making sure the team meets them and can show it, not doing all the work. See them all in the <a href="../../../guardrails/library/#role=delivery-manager">guardrail library, filtered to your role</a>.

## Patterns that help

No patterns yet. See the [patterns](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/) section.

## Working with architects

- Book architecture and security conversations into the plan for each phase - see [Deliver a service](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/).
- Use the evidence checklist for your phase before each assessment.
- Agree the support model and runbooks before public beta ([GR-OPS-05](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/observability-and-operations/#gr-ops-05)).
- Make sure suppliers know the guardrails from mobilisation - see [delivery partners](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/about/delivery-partners/).
