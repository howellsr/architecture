# Technical architect

<p class="lead">The guardrails a technical architect leads, what to show in each phase, the patterns that help and when to work with an architect.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



You shape the design so that it stays inside the guardrails, reuses what exists and can change safely. You lead decisions on hosting, integration and technology choices, and record them.

You lead **32 guardrails**, often with other roles. Leading means making sure the team meets them and can show it, not doing all the work. See them all in the <a href="../../../guardrails/library/#role=technical-architect">guardrail library, filtered to your role</a>.

## Patterns that help

- [Acting on behalf of an organisation or holding](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/acting-on-behalf/) - Users act for a business, a land holding or another person, and the service must check they are allowed to.
- [Asynchronous submission with an outbox](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/async-submission/) - A user submits something that other systems must process, and you do not want those systems' availability to block the user.
- [Reading from an authoritative source](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/authoritative-source/) - A service needs shared data - customers, organisations, holdings, locations or species - that another part of Defra owns.
- [File upload with malware scanning](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/file-upload/) - Users upload documents or images, and the files must be scanned and stored safely before anyone opens them.

## Working with architects

- Take novel or cross-cutting designs to the [Technical Design Authority](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/tda/).
- Keep the ADR log and C4 diagrams current through every phase.
