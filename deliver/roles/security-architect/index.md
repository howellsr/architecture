# Security architect

<p class="lead">The guardrails a security architect leads, what to show in each phase, the patterns that help and when to work with an architect.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



You make sure the service is secure by design and that risks are owned. You lead threat modelling, security testing and risk acceptance.

You lead **20 guardrails**, often with other roles. Leading means making sure the team meets them and can show it, not doing all the work. See them all in the <a href="../../../guardrails/library/#role=security-architect">guardrail library, filtered to your role</a>.

## Patterns that help

- [Acting on behalf of an organisation or holding](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/acting-on-behalf/) - Users act for a business, a land holding or another person, and the service must check they are allowed to.
- [Reading from an authoritative source](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/authoritative-source/) - A service needs shared data - customers, organisations, holdings, locations or species - that another part of Defra owns.
- [File upload with malware scanning](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/file-upload/) - Users upload documents or images, and the files must be scanned and stored safely before anyone opens them.
- [Publishing open data with metadata](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/open-data-publishing/) - You hold non-personal data that others could use, and want to publish it so it can be found, trusted and reused.

## Working with architects

- Run the first threat model with the whole team in alpha - see [threat modelling](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/security/threat-modelling/).
- Agree the IT health check scope before beta.
