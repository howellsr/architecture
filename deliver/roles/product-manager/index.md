# Product manager

<p class="lead">The guardrails a product manager leads, what to show in each phase, the patterns that help and when to work with an architect.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



You decide what the team builds and in what order. Many guardrails are trade-offs you prioritise - reuse, exit plans, service levels and the end of a product's life.

You lead **16 guardrails**, often with other roles. Leading means making sure the team meets them and can show it, not doing all the work. See them all in the <a href="../../../guardrails/library/#role=product-manager">guardrail library, filtered to your role</a>.

## Patterns that help

- [File upload with malware scanning](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/file-upload/) - Users upload documents or images, and the files must be scanned and stored safely before anyone opens them.
- [Publishing open data with metadata](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/open-data-publishing/) - You hold non-personal data that others could use, and want to publish it so it can be found, trusted and reused.

## Working with architects

- In discovery, agree with an architect what already exists that you could reuse, before you commit to building or buying.
- Before any procurement, talk to the architecture team ([GR-TECH-06](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/choosing-technology/#gr-tech-06)).
- Agree the service tier and the non-functional requirements that come with it in alpha - see [service tiers](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/nfrs/service-tiers/).
- Bring decisions that are hard to reverse to your solution design authority, with an ADR.
