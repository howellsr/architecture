# Service designer

<p class="lead">The guardrails a service designer leads, what to show in each phase, the patterns that help and when to work with an architect.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



You design the whole service, across channels and organisations. Decisions about identity, acting on behalf, data Defra already holds and what happens when things go wrong shape the user experience and are architecture decisions too.

You lead **11 guardrails**, often with other roles. Leading means making sure the team meets them and can show it, not doing all the work. See them all in the <a href="../../../guardrails/library/#role=service-designer">guardrail library, filtered to your role</a>.

## Patterns that help

- [Acting on behalf of an organisation or holding](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/acting-on-behalf/) - Users act for a business, a land holding or another person, and the service must check they are allowed to.
- [Reading from an authoritative source](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/authoritative-source/) - A service needs shared data - customers, organisations, holdings, locations or species - that another part of Defra owns.

## Working with architects

- In discovery, map the current journey against the systems and data behind it with an architect.
- In alpha, test the riskiest assumptions on both the user and the technical side together.
- Record decisions that shape the user experience in ADRs, as a contributor.
