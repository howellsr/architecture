# Discovery

<p class="lead">Discovery is about understanding the problem, not choosing technology. The architecture job is to find what already exists, spot constraints early and avoid committing to a solution too soon.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



## What it means for architecture

- Say which whole service and service your work is part of, and which products it changes - see [services and capabilities](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/services-and-capabilities/).
- Find out which [business capabilities](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/business-capabilities/) the service supports and what Defra already has that you can reuse.
- Identify the authoritative sources for the data you will need - see [Defra on a page](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/data/defra-on-a-page/).
- Spot constraints early: personal data, security classification, legacy systems, suppliers and contracts.
- Do not start a procurement or commit to a product without talking to the architecture team.

## Guardrails that apply

These guardrails apply in discovery, taken from each guardrail's metadata. Meet every Must, or have an approved [exception](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/exceptions/). Depart from a Should only with a recorded reason.

## Architecture artefacts

| Artefact | What to do in this phase |
| --- | --- |
| [Architecture decision record (ADR) log](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/architecture-decision-records/) ([template](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/templates/adr/)) | Start the log. Record the reuse options you considered. |
| [C4 system context diagram](https://c4model.com/) | Sketch the context - users, Defra systems and partners involved. |
| [Service tier](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/nfrs/service-tiers/) | Propose a tier with the service owner. |
| [Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/) | Screen for personal data and decide whether you need a full DPIA. |

## Governance touchpoints

- Map the service to [business capabilities](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/business-capabilities/) and check [technology capabilities](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/technology-capabilities/) for something to reuse.
- Use the [decision check](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/decision-check/) to agree your governance route and [solution design authority](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/solution-design-authorities/).
- Talk to the architecture team before any procurement starts, and record spend as described in [spend control](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/delivery-groups/follow-delivery-governance/assurance/spend-control) ([GR-TECH-06](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/choosing-technology/#gr-tech-06)).
- Name the security risk owner ([GR-SEC-01](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/security/#gr-sec-01)).

## Evidence pack

Bring these together once and reuse them for your solution design authority, service assessment, spend control and security assurance:

- Architecture decision record (ADR) log
- C4 system context diagram
- Service tier
- Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)
- evidence for each Must guardrail above (9)

Use the [discovery evidence checklist](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/checklists/discovery/) to gather and print it.

For how the phase works and what assessors look for, see the GOV.UK Service Manual on [discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works) and the [Defra Digital Service Manual](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/service-manual). This site covers the architecture evidence only.
