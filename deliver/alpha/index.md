# Alpha

<p class="lead">Alpha is where you test the riskiest design assumptions. Most of the architecture decisions that are expensive to reverse are made here, so this is the phase that needs the most architecture attention.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



## What it means for architecture

- Try out options for hosting, identity, integration and data, starting from the strategic options in the [handrail](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/handrail/).
- Start from a [service pattern](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/patterns/service/) where one fits.
- Run your first threat model with the whole team.
- Agree your service tier and non-functional requirements, so beta has targets to build and test against.

## Guardrails that apply

These guardrails apply in alpha, taken from each guardrail's metadata. Meet every Must, or have an approved [exception](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/exceptions/). Depart from a Should only with a recorded reason.

## Governance touchpoints

- Share your architecture, ADR log and threat model with your solution design authority before the alpha assessment.
- Take novel or cross-cutting designs, and any exception to a Must, to the [Technical Design Authority](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/tda/).
- Engage the platform teams - see [getting onto Defra platforms](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/platforms/).

## Evidence pack

Bring these together once and reuse them for your solution design authority, service assessment, spend control and security assurance:

- Architecture decision record (ADR) log
- C4 system context diagram
- C4 container diagram
- Threat model
- Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)
- Service tier
- Non-functional requirements (NFRs)
- Exit plan
- evidence for each Must guardrail above (18)

Use the [alpha evidence checklist](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/checklists/alpha/) to gather and print it.

For how the phase works and what assessors look for, see the GOV.UK Service Manual on [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) and the [Defra Digital Service Manual](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/service-manual). This site covers the architecture evidence only.
