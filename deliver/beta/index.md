# Beta

<p class="lead">Beta is where you build the real service and prove it is secure, reliable and ready to run. The architecture job is to keep the design and the evidence in step with what you build.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



## What it means for architecture

- Build on the platforms you chose in alpha and keep the ADR log current as the design changes.
- Test against your NFRs, including performance, recovery and accessibility.
- Build and test security controls and commission an IT health check before going live.
- Agree how the service will be supported in live before public beta.

## Guardrails that apply

These guardrails apply in beta, taken from each guardrail's metadata. Meet every Must, or have an approved [exception](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/exceptions/). Depart from a Should only with a recorded reason.

| [C4 container diagram](https://c4model.com/) | Update it to match what you built. |
| [Threat model](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/security/threat-modelling/) ([template](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/templates/threat-model/)) | Review it as controls are built and tested. |
| [Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/) | Update it for anything that has changed. |
| [Non-functional requirements (NFRs)](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/nfrs/catalogue/) | Test against them and record the results. |
| [Exit plan](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/choosing-technology/#gr-tech-03) | Confirm contracts give Defra its data and the right to export it. |
| [Runbooks and support model](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/observability-and-operations/#gr-ops-05) | Write them and agree the support model before public beta. |

## Governance touchpoints

- Go through the operational service design review board at the start of beta - see [operational service readiness](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/delivery-groups/follow-delivery-governance/assurance/operational-service-readiness) in the Defra Digital Service Manual.
- Commission an IT health check before go-live ([GR-SEC-06](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/security/#gr-sec-06)).
- Get residual security risks accepted through the [security exception process](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/security/managing-exceptions/).
- Share the updated evidence pack with your solution design authority before the beta assessment.

## Evidence pack

Bring these together once and reuse them for your solution design authority, service assessment, spend control and security assurance:

- Architecture decision record (ADR) log
- C4 container diagram
- Threat model
- Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)
- Non-functional requirements (NFRs)
- Exit plan
- Runbooks and support model
- evidence for each Must guardrail above (25)

Use the [beta evidence checklist](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/checklists/beta/) to gather and print it.

For how the phase works and what assessors look for, see the GOV.UK Service Manual on [beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works) and the [Defra Digital Service Manual](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/service-manual). This site covers the architecture evidence only.
