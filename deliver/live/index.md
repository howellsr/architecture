# Live

<p class="lead">A live service is never finished. The architecture job is to keep it secure, supported and affordable, and to keep the evidence current so the next team can change it safely.</p>

!!! warning "Prototype - testing with users"
    This section is an early prototype that we are testing with users. It may change a lot, and some of it may be wrong. Check with your solution design authority before relying on it, and tell us what works and what does not through the feedback link above.



## What it means for architecture

- Keep the threat model, ADR log and diagrams current.
- Watch service levels, cost and carbon, and act on what you learn.
- Patch and update dependencies continuously.
- Review exceptions before they expire, and treat significant changes as their own small delivery.

## Guardrails that apply

These guardrails apply in live, taken from each guardrail's metadata. Meet every Must, or have an approved [exception](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/exceptions/). Depart from a Should only with a recorded reason.

## Architecture artefacts

| [Architecture decision record (ADR) log](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/architecture-decision-records/) ([template](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/templates/adr/)) | Keep recording decisions. Supersede ADRs rather than deleting them. |
| [C4 container diagram](https://c4model.com/) | Keep it current. |
| [Threat model](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/security/threat-modelling/) ([template](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/templates/threat-model/)) | Review it at least once a year. |
| [Runbooks and support model](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/observability-and-operations/#gr-ops-05) | Test them and keep them current. |
| [Exit plan](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/guardrails/choosing-technology/#gr-tech-03) | Review it at contract renewal. |

## Governance touchpoints

- Share your evidence pack with your solution design authority before the live assessment.
- Review exceptions before they expire - see [exceptions to guardrails](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/governance/exceptions/).
- Treat significant changes as their own small delivery - see [significant change](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/significant-change/).

## Evidence pack

Bring these together once and reuse them for your solution design authority, service assessment, spend control and security assurance:

- Architecture decision record (ADR) log
- C4 container diagram
- Threat model
- Runbooks and support model
- Exit plan
- evidence for each Must guardrail above (25)

Use the [live evidence checklist](https://howellsr.github.io/architecture/deliver/checklists/live/) to gather and print it.

For how the phase works and what assessors look for, see the GOV.UK Service Manual on [live](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works) and the [Defra Digital Service Manual](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/service-manual). This site covers the architecture evidence only.
